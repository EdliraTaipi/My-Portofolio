### **🔥 Idea: 3D AI Chatbot NPC (Non-Playable Character) for Your Portfolio**
**Concept:**  
Instead of a regular text-based chatbot, your AI assistant is a **3D virtual character (NPC)** that visitors can **talk to inside your portfolio**. This interactive assistant can answer FAQs, guide users through your work, and even make jokes or offer career advice.

## **🕹️ How It Works:**
1. **User walks up to the AI Chatbot NPC**  
   - A 3D character (robot, holographic assistant, or digital avatar of yourself) appears.  
   - It waves and says: *"Hello! I’m your AI guide. Ask me anything!"*  

2. **Voice or Text-Based Conversation**  
   - Users can either **type** questions or **use voice commands**.  
   - The AI responds with text & animations (e.g., nodding, waving, or pointing to sections).  
   - It can provide information about:  
     ✅ Your projects  
     ✅ Your skills & experience  
     ✅ Your resume (offers a download link)  
     ✅ Programming jokes & fun facts  

3. **Smart Navigation**  
   - If the user asks: *"Show me your React projects!"*, the NPC **points to the section** or opens a floating window.  
   - If the user asks: *"What’s your best project?"*, it highlights your top-rated work.  

4. **Easter Egg Feature (Fun Mode!)**  
   - If a user types **"Tell me a joke"**, the bot does a **funny animation** while telling a programming joke.  
   - If they type **"Debug mode"**, the chatbot shows a random **error message** for fun.
